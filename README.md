Easily keep track of Warframe ability timers. Made with Chroma's vex armor in mind for during Eidolon hunts since you can't see Chroma's vex armor timer while in operator mode.

KeyCode field is for the key code representing the key of the ability. Ex: 3 is represented by 51 (the default)

This is more proof of concept than anything and not a finished program, I have plans to add to it and make it more user friendly, more options, etc.
